# Snowcast-Showdown
Snowcast Showdown Challenge

## Ideas
- encode time and location properly -> time: sinusodial etc.
- use ensemble with different models trained on different data
  - use different satelite imagery for different models as training input  
- Ensemble over standard model
- Use Cross Validation and make Ensemble
  - make model bigger
- use L2 loss + regularization

06.01 - Submission Ideas
- MAE, dim=40, batch_size=32 w/o train_labels.csv
- Try Philips big data augmentation --> someday try this also with train_labels.csv
- first cyclic date encoding model
